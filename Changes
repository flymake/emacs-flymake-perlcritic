* flymake-perlcritic.el 1.0.2 (candidate)
  * Add support for flymake-find-perl-lib-dir by modifying PERL5LIB
    so that both perl -c and perlcritic find the project lib dir.
  * Add help-text to flymake_perlcritic.
  * Use flymake-create-temp-with-folder-structure to prevent Perl::Critic
    complaining that package declarations don't match filename.
